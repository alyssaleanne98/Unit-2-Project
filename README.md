### Project Introduction 
"A-Bar Manager" is a coffee menu manager personally created as a tool for an aspiring coffee shop. On my coffee menu manager, I am able to view the coffee items on my menu, with the ability to edit, update, and create new drinks to add. 



### Key learnings/takeaways 
1. The most difficult aspect of creating a full-crud application is fully understanding the purpose/functionality behind every code. An important key takeaway is to invest the time to understand how I learn most efficiently. For me, that involved plenty of pseudocoding (you can never pseudocode "too much" throughout the course of this project. 


### Future Enhancements 
1. A future enhancement I'd like to incorporate into this project is an authentication for the user (me) to manage the application. I hope to incorporate an additional model(s) that'll include more food items to the menu.

### Issues and Resolutions 
1. An issue I experienced throughout the course of this project is maintaining the organization and cleanliness of my code. Although building a full-crud application is more complex compared to our unit-1 project(front-end portfolio), I found this project to be straight-forward. I struggled the most with understanding flexbox through CSS, and creating an application to be as similar as the vision I had hoped to deliver.
