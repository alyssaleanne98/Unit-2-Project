# Unit-2 Project Readme

| Demonstrate the Project |

https://cervantes-unit2-project.herokuapp.com/coffee


☐ Intro your app by paraphrasing the README.

☐ Launch the app by clicking the link in the README.

☐ Be sure to demo full-CRUD data operations.

# Show/discuss your code:

☐ Show the "main" Mongoose model.
☐ Show your favorite EJS template.
My favorite EJS template would have to be my index.ejs because of the menu display and styling.

☐ Show the controller for the main model.

Share the experience:

☐ What was your biggest challenge?

☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
1. Personally, when learning how to build a full crud app, it was easy to lose track of the purpose behind every task that I was completing. A key takeaway for me was to find how I learn best, and that included pseudocoding along the way as I was creating my routes. I found that to be extremely helpful.


# Q & A + Feedback 



## Issues and Resolutions 
1. Full crud applications are very abundant and complex due to the required files, installations, database(or databases) and more lines of code in general. Something that I struggled with was to stay organized with my code and keeping it as clean as possible. Although building a full crud application is more complex compared to our unit-1 project, I found our unit-2 project to go a lot smoother. I ran into some roadblocks when it came to styling, specifically with flexbox. Taking advantage of the resources and help that I received from the instructors and students really helped overcome those roadblocks.
