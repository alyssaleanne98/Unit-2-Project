# Project Introduction 
"A-Bar Manager" is a coffee menu manager personally created as a tool for an aspiring coffee shop. On my coffee menu manager, I am able to view the coffee items on my menu, with the ability to edit, update, and create new drinks to add. 

# Your favorite EJS template 
My favorite EJS template would have to be my index.ejs because of the menu display and styling.

# Key learnings/takeaways 
1. Personally, when learning how to build a full crud app, it was easy to lose track of the purpose behind every task that I was completing. A key takeaway for me was to find how I learn best, and that included pseudocoding along the way as I was creating my routes. I found that to be extremely helpful.


# Future Enhancements 
1. A future enhancement could include an authentication for the user (me) who will manage the coffee shop. I would eventually like to add at least one or more database(s) that include other food items such as pastries and non-coffee items.

# Issues and Resolutions 
1. One thing that I struggled with was staying organized throughout the course of building my application, and keeping it as clean as possible. Although building a full crud application is more complex compared to our unit-1 project, I found our unit-2 project went a lot smoother. I ran into some roadblocks when it came to styling, specifically with flexbox. Taking advantage of the resources and help that I received from the instructors and students really helped overcome those roadblocks.
